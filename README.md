# RPGame
My first, messily coded, text based RPG game.

simple RPG game v 2.0
made to be good fun or a good time waster
Your are simple townsperson goes an a quest to kill goblins and orcs, and recieves a bounty for each orc/goblin killed to get better weapons
and health boosts/potions
the game is rather pointless,  but the combat engine is nice considering there is armor classes and different weapon types have different bonuses/nerfs
melee has a bonus against ranged (1.25x) but a nerf against magic (0.75x)
ranged has a bonus against magic (1.25x) but a nerf against magic (0.75x)
magic has a bonus against melee (1.25x) but a nerf against ranged attacks (0.75x)

To be updated with an armor shop soon.
